	<p> Hello, my name is Yessenia Cruz I'm 16 years old and I go to Making Waves Academy</p>
		
<h2>Personality</h2>
		
	<p>I would say I am a very shy person. I tend to not talk in large areas or when there are people that I do not know that are around, well unless necessary. I just perfer not too</p>
	<p>I also stugggle to multitask. Which is why I am bad at cooking. I tend to be all over the place since there are a lot of things to do at once. So I begin to freak out and begin to ask for help</p>
	<p>Thats why, what I do to calm me down, is that I listen music. While I do enjoy listening to music I really never look into the artist or begin to obses over them. Since my music choice changes a lot.</p>

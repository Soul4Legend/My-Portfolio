 <h1>Yessenia's Portfolio</h1>
	<p> Hello, my name is Yessenia Cruz. I am a person who loves to do hands on work and I love to learn.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
	<p>I would say I am a very shy person. I tend to not talk in large areas or when there are people that I do not know that are around, well unless necessary. I just perfer not to</p>
	<p>I also stugggle to multitask. Which is why I am bad at cooking. I tend to be all over the place since there are a lot of things to do at once. So I begin to freak out and begin to ask for help</p>
	<p>Thats why, what I do to calm me down, is that I listen music. While I do enjoy listening to music I really never look into the artist or begin to obses over them. Since my music choice changes a lot.</p>
<h3> Hobbies</h3>
	<p> My main hobbies are:</p>
	<center>
		<p>Sewing; I really like how calming it is and its a great thing to do while watching TV or having a conversation</p>
		<p>Drawing/Doodling; mainly I tend to draw characters and I really like to draw animals/creatures. Its more fun than drawing people.</p>

 <h1>Yessenia's Portfolio</h1>
	<p> Hello, my name is Yessenia Cruz. I am a person who loves to do hands on work and I love to learn.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
	<p>I would say I am a very shy person. I tend to not talk in large araes or when there are people that I do not know that are around, well unless necessary. I just perfer not to</p>
	<p>I also stugggle to multitask. Which is why I am bad at cooking. I tend to be all over the place since there are a lot of things to do at once. So i begin to freak out and begin to ask for help</p>
	<p>Thats why, what tends to calm me down is music. I like to listen to it. I really never look into the artist and begin to obses with them. Since I know my music chice changes a lot.</p>
